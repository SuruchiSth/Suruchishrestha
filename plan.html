  <section id="goal">
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Build a small, clear website for <em>100SMILES Dental Care</em> that helps new patients
      find the clinic quickly and book an appointment. My measurable goal is to increase
      online enquiries/bookings by <strong>at least 20% in the first month</strong> after launch (measured by
      email and phone enquiries from the site), and reduce “where are you located?” calls by
      <strong>at least 30%</strong> by making address, hours and contact details obvious on every page.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="success">
    <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      I will measure success using simple, practical checks that match the goal:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enquiries count:</strong> Track weekly email enquiries sent via the site (contact link) and phone calls from the number on the site (ask reception to tally).</li>
      <li><strong>Bookings from email promo:</strong> Count how many people use the “20% off first visit by email booking” offer in the first month.</li>
      <li><strong>Findability:</strong> Ask two classmates to find “address” and “trading hours” from the home page in under 10 seconds (quick hallway test).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="target">
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p><strong>Primary audience:</strong> Local families in and around Razole looking for a friendly dental clinic for check-ups, cleaning, emergency care and ongoing preventative care. This includes parents booking for children, young adults, and retirees.</p>
    <p><strong>Design choices for this audience:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear contact &amp; hours on every page:</strong> phone number, address, and “Book by email” note in header/footer.</li>
      <li><strong>Plain language:</strong> turn the client’s content into short, scannable sections with headings and bullets.</li>
      <li><strong>Quick services overview:</strong> highlight check-ups, cleanings, implants, orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry and emergency care, with a short “What to expect”.</li>
      <li><strong>Trust signals:</strong> “50+ years’ experience”, long-standing local clinic, and friendly staff introductions with photos.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile-friendly:</strong> simple layout, readable text, and images compressed for faster loading.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="flowchart">
    <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
    <p>My site map shows a simple structure with one Home page linking to four main sections.
       The link order here is the same order I will use in the site navigation.</p>
